          <div><p>Isaac Guerrero does not believe in ghosts. He never has and doesn’t want to start now. But someone or something is forcing him to change his mind. For as long as he can remember, he has seen the dark figure of a woman appear in the corner of his bedroom. He is also sure that when she appears, she is staring straight at him. He can feel that. But she can't be real, can she? Even though she had turned up in the corner of every bedroom he has ever had, from home, to random hotel rooms on vacation, to his dormitory room in college. But whatever this thing is, he has to acknowledge that it has nothing to do with any particular location. No, it has everything to do with Isaac himself. Now autumn has come to The Poet’s Corner Bookstore where he works and with it, a disturbing change in the haunting he tries so hard to deny. He’s heard the ghost stories at work, including those involving coworkers Cassie Valentine and Michael Penfield, and those stories should have been enough to convince him that the two might be of great help. But he's not sure he believes enough to even consider the idea of seeking their assistance. That is, until the haunting, his haunting, makes itself known to everyone around him and he has no choice but to confront the ghost he can't believe exists.</p></div>
